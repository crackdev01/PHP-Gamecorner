# Gamestop


Started coding: dec, 2018.

1 month in the bootcamp at CodeGorilla Breda, (february 2019) we learned to work with a database, and how we can work with mySQL. 

We were assigned to create our first database with phpmyadmin and create a E-commerce website.

I decided to make a website about games. I putted all information about each specific game in the database and retrieve the information with sql queries on the page.

Was again a really learnfull week, where I learned a lot about how databases work, how you can join tables, make relational tables, and retrieve specific data with queries.
